Steno.io
=====

**The best way to hide something is to put it where everyone can see it.**

Electronic encrypted communication attract attention. Because your privacy matter, Steno gives you the ability to send messages looking like normal text with the robustness of an encryption algorithm.

## How it works
Steno.io use the [Puzzle algorithm](http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/551) to generate a secure relation between two sets of words based on your password. The words in your message are then replaced by their coresponding ones in the other set. The key size start at 512 bits and grow with your password's size, there is no limit to it. This is an alpha version and right now the ciphered message doesn't have a meaning. This will be improved in further releases.</p>

The application is made entirely in javascript. There is no cookie, no server, no information sent/received or saved. Everything happens in your browser. You can even download the page and use it offline. Once you're done just send your encrypted message via your habitual channel of communication. You can even write it down on a postal card, it is a lot harder to track than emails.

Open source application create more secure and better software, giving back the control of the information to the users. This is why Steno.io is under the [BSD license](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause/).
